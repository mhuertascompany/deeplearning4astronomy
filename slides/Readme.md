This folder contains all the slides presented during the course.

They shoud be read in the following order:
- classical_ML: an introduction to classical supervised machine learning (SVMs, RFs)
- ANNs: Artifical Neural Networks
- CNNs_1 and CNNs_2: Convolutional Neural Netowrks (inncluding decoders-encoders)
- unsupervised: an introduction to unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- generative: very brief overview of generative models (VAEs, GANs)
