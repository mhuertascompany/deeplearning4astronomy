# SDSS with a Deep approach
The goal of this exercice is to develop a deep net to build a sample of nearby early-type spirals (Sa-b) in the SDSS. 
- The training set is made of the detailed visual classifications of [Nair&Abraham2010](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJS..186..427N) of ~14.000 SDSS galaxies. 
Use the TType column.
- We will give priority to solutions that boost purity, although completeness is also important.
- The jpeg images can be donwnloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ufj6ATroZ3emBbSQfQhcL_6W87EPgTaS?usp=sharing). The name is  matched to the ID in the catalog.
- A very simple [jupyter notebook]() using a 2 layer ConvNet classifier is provided.
