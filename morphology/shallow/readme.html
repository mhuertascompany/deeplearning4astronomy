The goal of this exercice is to develop a classical machine learning algorithm to build a sample of early-type spirals (Sa-b). 
The training set is made of the detailed visual classification of [Nair&Abraham2010](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJS..186..427N). Use the TType column.
All measurements included in the catalog provided can be used (or any other of your choice!).
We will give priority to solutions that boost purity, although completeness is also importat.
